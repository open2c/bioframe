        The number of neighbors to report.

    tie_arr : numpy.ndarray or None
        Extra data describing intervals in set 2 to break ties when multiple intervals
        are located at the same distance. Intervals with *lower* tie_arr values will
        be given priority.

    ignore_overlaps : bool
        If True, ignore set 2 intervals that overlap with set 1 intervals.

    ignore_upstream, ignore_downstream : bool
        If True, ignore set 2 intervals upstream/downstream of set 1 intervals.

    direction : numpy.ndarray with dtype bool or None
        Strand vector to define the upstream/downstream orientation of the intervals.

    Returns
    -------
    closest_ids : numpy.ndarray
        An Nx2 array containing the indices of pairs of closest intervals.
        The 1st column contains ids from the 1st set, the 2nd column has ids
        from the 2nd set.
