bioframe
========

`Bioframe <https://github.com/open2c/bioframe>`_ is a library to enable flexible and scalable operations on genomic interval dataframes in python. Building bioframe directly on top of `pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_ enables immediate access to a rich set of dataframe operations. Working in python enables rapid visualization and iteration of genomic analyses.
