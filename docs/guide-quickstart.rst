Quickstart
==========

Installation
------------

::

    $ pip install bioframe

To install the latest development version of `bioframe` from
github, first make a local clone of the github repository:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/open2c/bioframe

Then, compile and install `bioframe` in
`development mode <https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#development-mode>`_. This installs the package without moving it to a system folder, and thus allows for testing changes to the python code on the fly.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd bioframe
    $ pip install -e ./
